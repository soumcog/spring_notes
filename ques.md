**Spring Framework:**

1. **What is Spring Framework?**  Spring is a comprehensive, lightweight, and open-source framework for building enterprise Java applications. It provides infrastructure support at all layers, promoting good design practices and reducing boilerplate code.

2. **What are the core modules of Spring?**  Core Container, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), Data Access/Integration, Web, Test, etc.

3. **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?** DI is a design pattern where dependencies are provided (injected) to an object from the outside, rather than the object creating its own dependencies.  It promotes loose coupling and testability.

4. **What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?** IoC is a principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is inverted from the application code to a container or framework (like Spring).

5. **What are the different types of DI in Spring?** Constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection.

6. **What are Spring Beans?** Spring beans are objects managed by the Spring IoC container. They are instantiated, configured, and assembled by the container.

7. **What is the `@Component` annotation used for?**  `@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component. `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` are specializations of `@Component`.

8. **What is Spring AOP?** Spring AOP provides support for aspect-oriented programming, allowing you to modularize cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) that affect multiple parts of your application.

9. **What is an Aspect?**  An aspect is a modular unit of cross-cutting functionality.

10. **What are Spring Data JPA and Hibernate?** Spring Data JPA simplifies data access by providing a consistent interface for working with JPA providers. Hibernate is one of the most popular JPA implementations.

11. **What is a `JpaRepository`?**  `JpaRepository` is an interface in Spring Data JPA that provides basic CRUD operations for an entity.

12. **What is the difference between `@Autowired` and `@Resource`?** `@Autowired` is Spring's annotation for dependency injection by type, while `@Resource` is a JSR-250 annotation for injection by name.

13. **What is Spring Security?** Spring Security is a framework for providing authentication and authorization in Java applications.

14. **What are different ways to configure Spring Security?** XML configuration, Java configuration, and annotation-based configuration.


**Spring Boot:**

15. **What is Spring Boot?** Spring Boot simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and other features to reduce boilerplate and get you up and running quickly.

16. **What is Spring Boot auto-configuration?** Auto-configuration is a mechanism in Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the dependencies present on the classpath.

17. **What is `application.properties` or `application.yml`?**  These files are used for configuring your Spring Boot application (e.g., database connection, server port).

18. **What are Spring Boot Starters?**  Starters are dependency descriptors that include a set of related dependencies, simplifying dependency management in your `pom.xml`.

19. **What are Spring Boot Actuators?** Actuators provide production-ready features for monitoring and managing your Spring Boot application (e.g., health checks, metrics).

20. **How do you create a REST controller in Spring Boot?** Use the `@RestController` annotation.

21. **What is `@RequestMapping`?** `@RequestMapping` maps HTTP requests to controller methods.

22. **What is the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?**  `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, so controller methods automatically return data directly in the response body (usually as JSON).

23. **What is `@PathVariable`?**  `@PathVariable` extracts values from the URI path (e.g., `/users/{id}`).

24. **What is `@RequestBody`?** `@RequestBody` maps the request body to a method parameter.


**Microtask Project:**


25. **What is the purpose of the microtask application?** To connect employers with workers for small tasks.

26. **What are the main entities in the application?** `Job` and `User`.

27. **Describe the relationship between the `Job` and `User` entities.**  A `User` (Employer) can create many `Jobs` (one-to-many relationship).

28. **How are the CRUD operations for jobs implemented?** Using `JobRepository`, `JobService`, and `JobController`.

29. **How is authentication handled in the application?**  Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Spring Security.

30. **How are passwords stored?** Passwords are securely stored using BCrypt hashing.

31. **What is the role of `JwtService`?**  It handles JWT generation, validation, and extraction of user details from the token.

32. **What is the purpose of `JwtAuthenticationFilter`?**  It intercepts requests, extracts the JWT, validates it, and sets the authentication context.


33. **What is the role of `AuthenticationService`?** It handles the logic for user registration and login, and delegates JWT generation to `JwtService`.

34. **Why are DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used?** DTOs help decouple entities from external APIs and provide data suitable for the client.

35. **How is data validation implemented?** Using validation annotations (e.g., `@NotBlank`, `@NotNull`) in the DTOs and entity classes.

36. **How is error handling implemented?** Using try-catch blocks and custom exception classes like `ResourceNotFoundException`.

37. **What are the different user roles?**  `ADMIN`, `EMPLOYER`, and `WORKER`.

38. **How will authorization be implemented?** Using Spring Security's `@PreAuthorize` annotation on controller methods.

39.  **What database are you using and why?** MySQL was chosen because it is relational, is ACID compliant, and has a large community and good documentation.



**General Spring Boot/Spring Security Concepts:**

40. **What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?**  Simplified development, auto-configuration, embedded servers, production-ready features (actuators).

41. **What are the key features of Spring Security?**  Authentication, authorization, protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS).

42. **What is CSRF?** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to a website the user is currently logged into.

43. **How does Spring Security handle CSRF?** Spring Security provides mechanisms to generate and validate CSRF tokens, preventing CSRF attacks.

44. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**  Authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization determines what a user is allowed to access.


**Design and Scalability:**

45. **How would you scale the microtask application for a large number of users and jobs?**  Using techniques like database optimization, caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.

46. **What are some considerations for database optimization?**  Indexing, query optimization, database sharding, using a connection pool.

47. **How can caching improve performance?** Caching can reduce database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

48. **What are some popular caching solutions?**  Redis, Memcached, Ehcache.



**Deployment and Testing:**

49. **How do you typically deploy Spring Boot applications?**  As JAR files, WAR files, or using containerization technologies like Docker.

50. **What testing frameworks have you used with Spring Boot?** Spring Test, JUnit, Mockito, Postman (For API testing).  You can choose one or multiple according to your preference.





This comprehensive list should prepare you well for your mock interview. Focus on understanding the concepts and relating them to your project experience. Good luck!
