Let's break down the code files and the application flow for your microtask application.

**Code Files and Explanations:**

1.  **`MicrotaskAppApplication.java` (Main Application Class):**

    *   This is the entry point of your Spring Boot application.  The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation enables auto-configuration, component scanning, and other Spring Boot features.

2. **`SecurityConfig.java` (Security Configuration):**

* This class configures Spring Security, JWT authentication, and authorization.
* It defines which endpoints are protected and which are publicly accessible.
* It sets up the JWT authentication filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`).
* It defines the AuthenticationProvider and `PasswordEncoder` beans.
* It enables stateless session management (important for REST APIs).


3.  **`AuthenticationController.java` (Authentication Endpoints):**

    *   Handles user registration (`/register`) and login (`/login`) requests.
    *   Uses `AuthenticationService` to perform the registration and login logic.

4. **`AuthenticationService.java` /`AuthenticationServiceImpl.java` (Authentication Logic):**

*   `AuthenticationService` interface defines the methods for authentication (registration and login).
*   `AuthenticationServiceImpl` implements the logic for user registration (including password encoding and username uniqueness checks) and login (authentication and JWT generation).

5.  **`JobController.java` (Job Management Endpoints):**

    *   Handles CRUD operations for jobs (`/jobs`).
    *   Uses `JobService` to perform the business logic.

6.  **`JobService.java` / `JobServiceImpl.java` (Job Management Logic):**

    *   `JobService` interface defines the methods for Job CRUD.
    *   `JobServiceImpl` implements these operations using `JobRepository`.

7.  **`JobRepository.java` (Database Access):**

    *   Extends `JpaRepository` to provide database access for the `Job` entity.

8.  **`Job.java` (Job Entity):**

    *   Represents a job in the database.

9.  **`User.java` (User Entity):**

    *   Represents a user (admin, employer, or worker) in the database.

10. **`RegisterRequestDTO.java`/`LoginRequestDTO.java`/`AuthenticationResponseDTO.java` (DTOs):**

    *   Data transfer objects used for request and response payloads (registration, login).


11. **`JwtService.java` (JWT Management):**

     *   Handles JWT generation, validation, and extraction of claims.



12. **`UserInfoUserDetailsService.java` (User Details Service):**

     *  Loads user details for authentication.

13. **`AuthenticationProviderImpl.java` (Authentication Provider):**

      *  Authenticates users.


14. **`JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` (JWT Authentication Filter):**

      *   Intercepts requests, extracts and validates JWTs.





**Application Flow:**

1.  **Registration:**  A user sends a registration request (`POST /api/auth/register`) with user details.  `AuthenticationController` receives the request, calls `AuthenticationService`, which creates a new `User` entity (encoding the password) and saves it using `UserRepository`.

2.  **Login:** A user sends a login request (`POST /api/auth/login`) with their username and password. `AuthenticationController` delegates to `AuthenticationService`, which authenticates the credentials using `AuthenticationManager`, if successful it generates a JWT using `JwtService` and sends the token back to the user.

3. **Accessing Protected Resources:** When a user wants to access a protected job endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/jobs`), they include the JWT in the `Authorization` header of their request.

4. **JWT Authentication Filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`):** This filter intercepts the request before it reaches the job controller. It extracts the JWT from the header, validates it using `JwtService`, and if valid, sets the authentication context (the authenticated user's details) in `SecurityContextHolder`.

5. **Authorization in `JobController` :**
    *   Spring Security checks if the user has the necessary role (if any is required) to access the requested endpoint. Access is granted only if the user is authenticated.
    *   `JobController` then proceeds with the appropriate action (create, read, update, or delete job) using `JobService`, which interacts with the database via `JobRepository`.

6.  **Response:** The `JobController` returns a response to the client, containing the requested data or an appropriate status code (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, etc.).
