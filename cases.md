All right, here are sample test cases for all your API endpoints, including user registration, login, and the Job CRUD operations, demonstrating how to test with valid and invalid inputs, authentication, and authorization.  These examples use Postman, but you can adapt them to other API testing tools.

**I. User Registration (`/api/auth/register`):**

* **Test 1: Successful Registration:**

    * Method: `POST`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register`
    * Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
    * Body:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "newuser",
        "password": "strongPassword123",
        "email": "newuser@example.com",
        "role": "WORKER"
    }
    ```

    * Expected Response: 201 Created, "User registered successfully!"


* **Test 2: Duplicate Username:**

    * Method: `POST`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register`
    * Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
    * Body:  (Use the same username as a previously registered user)

    ```json
    {
        "username": "newuser",  // Duplicate
        "password": "anotherPassword",
        "email": "newuser2@example.com",
        "role": "EMPLOYER"
    }
    ```

    * Expected Response: 409 Conflict, "Username already exists."



* **Test 3: Invalid Email:**

    * Method, URL, Headers: Same as above.
    * Body:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "anotheruser",
        "password": "somePassword",
        "email": "invalidemail", // Invalid email
        "role": "ADMIN"
    }
    ```

    * Expected Response: 400 Bad Request, Validation error message regarding email format.




**II. User Login (`/api/auth/login`):**

*   **Test 4: Successful Login:**

    *   Method: `POST`
    *   URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login`
    *   Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
    *   Body:

    ```json
    {
      "username": "newuser", // Registered user
      "password": "strongPassword123" // Correct password
    }
    ```

    *   Expected Response: 200 OK, JWT token in the response body.  Save this token for the next tests.



*   **Test 5: Invalid Credentials:**

    *   Method, URL, Headers: Same as above.
    *   Body:  (Incorrect password)

    ```json
    {
      "username": "newuser",
      "password": "wrongpassword"
    }
    ```

    *   Expected Response: 401 Unauthorized (or 400 Bad Request if you handle invalid credentials differently).



**III. Job CRUD Operations (`/api/jobs`):**

* **Note:** For test cases 6-10, include the JWT obtained from successful login (Test 4) in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.



* **Test 6: Create Job (POST):**

    * Method: `POST`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs`
    * Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`,  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    * Body:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "Test Job 1",
      "description": "This is a test job.",
      "category": "DATA_ENTRY",
      "reward": 5.00,
      "status": "OPEN"
    }
    ```

    * Expected Response: 201 Created, Job object with generated ID.


* **Test 7: Get All Jobs (GET):**

    * Method: `GET`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs`
    * Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    * Expected Response: 200 OK, Array of Job objects (including the one created in Test 6).


* **Test 8: Get Job by ID (GET):**

    * Method: `GET`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1` (Replace `1` with a valid job ID)
    * Headers:  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    * Expected Response: 200 OK, Job object with matching ID.


* **Test 9: Update Job (PUT):**

    * Method: `PUT`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1`
    * Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    * Body:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1, // Include existing job ID for verification
      "title": "Updated Job Title",
      "description": "Updated description.",
      "category": "WRITING",
      "reward": 7.50,
      "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
    }
    ```

    * Expected Response: 200 OK, Updated Job object.


* **Test 10: Delete Job (DELETE):**

    * Method: `DELETE`
    * URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1`
    * Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    * Expected Response: 204 No Content.


* **Test 11: Accessing Protected Resource without JWT:** Make any request to job endpoints (`/api/jobs`) without including the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    * Expected Response: `401 Unauthorized`.


These test cases provide good coverage of your API endpoints. Thoroughly test these scenarios, and add more tests as you incorporate new features.
