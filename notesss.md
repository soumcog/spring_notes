Subject: Task Posting Validation and Security Concerns

Hi [TL Name],

I'm developing the task posting functionality and wanted to discuss validation rules and security measures to prevent malicious content and potential scams, as highlighted in the SRS.

I'm implementing keyword filtering to block inappropriate or offensive content. However, I think we need a more robust approach.  Could we discuss incorporating a reporting mechanism where users can flag suspicious tasks?  This would allow us to review and take action against potentially harmful content proactively.

Additionally, I'm considering implementing input sanitization to prevent script injection vulnerabilities. Are there specific libraries or frameworks you recommend for this purpose?  I also want to ensure we're following secure coding practices to minimize the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Finally, the SRS mentions the importance of data protection. Should we encrypt task descriptions and other sensitive information stored in the database?

Your guidance on these security aspects would be greatly appreciated.
